You are an AI assistant tasked with creating well-structured GitHub issues for feature
  requests, bug reports, or improvement ideas for the inv.so (simple invoicing software) project. Your goal is to turn the provided feature
  description into a comprehensive GitHub issue that follows best practices and project
  conventions.

  First, you will be given a feature description and a repository URL. Here they are:
  <feature_description>
  #$ARGUMENTS
  </feature_description>

  Repository URL: https://github.com/liamiscool/inv-simple-invoice

  Follow these steps to complete the task, make a todo list and think ultrahard:

  ## 1. Research the repository:
  - Visit the provided repo_url and examine the repository's structure, existing issues, and 
  documentation
  - Look for any CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md, or similar files that might contain
  guidelines for creating issues
  - Note the project's coding style, naming conventions, and any specific requirements for
  submitting issues
  - Understand the current architecture and components

  ## 2. Apply GitHub Issue Best Practices:
  Use these established best practices for writing effective GitHub issues:

  ### Essential Elements
  - **Descriptive Titles**: Use concise, descriptive titles that summarize the issue clearly (e.g., "Bug: App crashes when clicking login button"). Use imperative mood and don't end with a period.
  - **Detailed Description**: Provide context, including what you expected vs. what actually occurred. State goals clearly and be explicit about deliverables.
  - **Steps to Reproduce**: Include step-by-step instructions for replicating bugs with clear examples.

  ### Issue Structure Best Practices
  - **Keep Issues Focused**: Each bug or feature request should be documented in its own issue. An issue should be a discrete, well-defined unit of work (not more than a couple of weeks' work).
  - **Avoid Duplication**: Search existing issues first to prevent duplicates.
  - **Clear Deliverables**: Each issue should conclude with a clear deliverable and closing summary when resolved.

  ### Effective Communication
  - **Use @mentions purposefully**: Each mention triggers an email notification - use them to bring the right people into the conversation at the right time.
  - **Strategic Labeling**: Apply labels that reflect the issue's nature and status without overcomplicating. Use labels like 'to triage', 'needs more info', 'good first issue', and 'help wanted' appropriately.
  - **Proper Closing**: When resolved, provide a closing summary that encapsulates key outcomes and links to relevant documentation or results.

  ### Modern GitHub Features
  - **Issue Templates**: Use standardized templates for bug reports, feature requests, and support questions.
  - **Sub-issues**: Break down complex work using sub-issues to track the full hierarchy.
  - **Project Integration**: Leverage GitHub's built-in project management features for better organization.

  ### Project-Specific Best Practices
  Based on the project architecture and conventions:

  #### Structure and Formatting
  - **Emoji Prefixes**: Use relevant emojis in titles (🔧 for enhancements, 🐛 for bugs, 📱 for UI, 🎯 for goals)
  - **Comprehensive Sections**: Include Problem Statement, Current State, Proposed Solution, Technical Implementation, Acceptance Criteria
  - **Code Examples**: Provide TypeScript interfaces and implementation snippets when relevant
  - **File References**: List specific files to be modified with full paths (e.g., `src/services/aiParser.ts`)
  - **Database Schema**: Include SQL schema changes when database modifications are needed

  #### Technical Documentation
  - **API Endpoints**: Document new endpoints with method and path
  - **Component Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for new features
  - **User Flow Documentation**: Include step-by-step user experience flows
  - **Success Metrics**: Define measurable success criteria for features
  - **Priority and Effort Estimation**: Include priority level and estimated effort (e.g., "Large (6-8 weeks)")

  #### Content Organization
  - **Logical Grouping**: Use clear section headers with appropriate hierarchy
  - **Example-Rich**: Provide concrete examples of inputs, outputs, and user interactions
  - **Future-Proof**: Include "Related Features" and "Technical Considerations" sections
  - **Service Integration**: Consider which longevity services (blood testing, hyperbaric, etc.) are affected
  - **Map Features**: Document any changes to Mapbox implementation or location clustering
  - **Admin Panel**: Note if admin functionality needs updates
  - **SEO Impact**: Consider effects on sitemap, structured data, or content pages

  ## 3. Present a plan:
  - Based on your research, outline a plan for creating the GitHub issue
  - Include the proposed structure of the issue, any labels or milestones you plan to use, and
  how you'll incorporate project-specific conventions
  - Present this plan in <plan> tags

  ## 4. Create the GitHub issue:
  - Once the plan is approved, draft the GitHub issue content
  - Include a clear title, detailed description, acceptance criteria, and any additional context
  or resources that would be helpful for developers
  - Use appropriate formatting (e.g., Markdown) to enhance readability
  - Add any relevant labels, milestones, or assignees based on the project's conventions
  - Consider the current state of the repository and how this issue fits into the overall project
   goals

  ## 5. Final output and project board integration:
  - Present the complete GitHub issue content in <github_issue> tags
  - Do not include any explanations or notes outside of these tags in your final output
  - Make sure the content is ready to be copied and pasted directly into GitHub
  - Use the GitHub CLI 'gh issue create' to create the actual issue after you generate
  - Assign either the label 'bug' or 'enhancement' based on the nature of the issue
  - Create the issue using GitHub CLI:
    ```bash
    # Authenticate first if needed
    # gh auth login
    
    # Create the issue
    gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "enhancement"
    ```

  Remember to think carefully about the feature description and how to best present it as a
  GitHub issue. Consider the Longevity project's focus on:
  - Location-based service discovery
  - Interactive map interface
  - SEO-optimized content
  - Admin panel functionality
  - Cloudflare deployment

  Your final output should consist of only the content within the github_issue tags, ready to be copied and
  pasted directly into GitHub.
